# Ruby Editor

The editor supplied with the core Ruby engine.<br>

**<span style="font-size:2em;text-decoration:underline">IMPORTANT!!!</span>**<br>
*As the editor is a work in progress, it should not be used currently for development, as it does not have the necessary tools to perform as it should. In the near future the editor will have at least enough tools to allow for the creation of basic games, and eventually it will be expanded to have a great and easy to use UI, and have extra quality of life tools that will make the development process easier.*
