Ruby2D is a game engine project for designing 2D games like RPGs. I have used The Cherno's series as guides for most of the setup of the projects, as I haven't had any prior exposure to this type of development. You can find his YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno), so go check him out!

## Usage
----------------- 
Ruby is currently under development, but when completed it will be a tool for game developers to create 2D games using an ImGui interface and other components needed for small scale game development.
